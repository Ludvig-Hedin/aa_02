### Autonomous AI Agent
- **Feature**: AI agent that can perform tasks without constant supervision
- **User Story**: As a user, I want to be able to delegate complex tasks to the AI and get the results when they're completed, without having to guide each step.
- **Technical Integration**: Implemented through integrations with `gpt-researcher` and `gptr.dev`.

### Deep Research
- **Feature**: Ability to perform comprehensive information gathering and analysis
- **User Story**: As a user, I want to be able to ask the AI for in-depth research on specific topics, so I get comprehensive and well-founded answers.
- **Technical Integration**: Implemented through `gpt-researcher` and `gptr.dev`.

### Calendar Integration
- **Feature**: Synchronization with calendar services
- **User Story**: As a user, I want the AI to have access to my calendar to be able to plan, remind, and optimize my time.
- **Technical Integration**: API integrations with popular calendar services.

### Screen Sharing with Voice Control
- **Feature**: Ability to share screen and control via voice commands
- **User Story**: As a user, I want to be able to share my screen and control the application with voice commands for hands-free interaction.
- **Technical Integration**: WebRTC for screen sharing, integrated speech-to-text functionality.

### Text-to-Speech Transcription
- **Feature**: Conversion of speech to text in real-time
- **User Story**: As a user, I want to be able to speak to the application and have my voice correctly transcribed to text.
- **Technical Integration**: Integration of local or API-based speech-to-text services.

### Video and Image Generation
- **Feature**: Generation of visual content
- **User Story**: As a user, I want to be able to ask the AI to create images and videos based on my descriptions.
- **Technical Integration**: Integration with `Wan2.1` for video generation and other repos for image generation.

### Support for Local Models
- **Feature**: Run AI models locally
- **User Story**: As a user, I want to be able to run AI models locally for better privacy and lower latency.
- **Technical Integration**: Support for `Deepseek`, `Qwen`, and `Llama` models.

### Support for API-based Models
- **Feature**: Access to cloud-based AI services
- **User Story**: As a user, I want to be able to use advanced cloud-based AI services for tasks that require more computational power.
- **Technical Integration**: API integrations with Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Modern, responsive design inspired by Sana Labs AI and ChatGPT
- React/Next.js as the primary frontend framework
- User interface optimized for both desktop and mobile devices

### Backend

  - Deepseek integration for advanced text processing
  - Qwen for efficient multimodal handling
  - Llama for local execution with minimal latency
- **API models**:
  - Gemini for multimedia use cases
  - ChatGPT for text generation and conversations
  - Claude for longer contexts and reasoning

### Component Integrations
- **Browser functionality**: Integration of `browser-use` and `web-ui`
- **Research capability**: Integration of `gpt-researcher` and `gptr.dev`
- **Multimedia**: Integration of `Wan2.1` for video generation

## Deployment Strategy

### Initial Deployment
- Hosting via Vercel for rapid deployment and easy scaling
- Supabase for user accounts, authentication, and database
